# Automate Map Image Creation from CSV Data

## Overview

The Map Screenshot Generator is a Python-based application designed to automate the process of creating map images based on addresses listed in CSV files. Utilizing the Mapbox API for geocoding and map rendering, this tool is ideal for users who need to generate visual representations of multiple locations efficiently. The application features a simple GUI for user input and processes CSV files to create map images, which are saved automatically.

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Install Python 3.x from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   - Install required Python libraries by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the project directory.
   - Download the Chrome WebDriver from [here](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads) and place it in the project folder or system path.
3. **Set Up Mapbox Access Token**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root.
   - Add `MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token_here` in the `.env` file.

## Usage

1. **Start the Application**: Run the script `python map_screenshot_generator.py`.
2. **Configure Settings**:
   - Set map dimensions and zoom level in the GUI.
   - Optionally, browse and select a specific CSV file or use the default folder `csv`.
3. **Run the Process**: Click the `Run` button to start processing addresses from the CSV file(s).
4. **Access Output**:

   - Processed CSV files are moved to the `csv_done` folder.

## CSV File Format

- Ensure the CSV files are in the format `Name;Address, City` (semicolon-separated values).
- Place CSV files in the `csv` folder or select them through the GUI.

## Known Limitations

- Internet speed and stability might affect the performance and accuracy of the map rendering.
- The free tier of Mapbox API has usage limits; consider upgrading for heavy usage.
